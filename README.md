Before the Sauna Business starts, some people who have invested in Crowdfunding have been invited to pre-open sauna. These people recieved the email with an ID for reserving the time for sauna in the pre-open period.
It requires an app which enables people to reserve the time slot in correct time period for those who only have the ID written in the invitation email. (used Google App Script to send to people automatically)
